	// 5.1
	// The happened-before relation is a relation between the result of two events. 
	// if one event happens before another event, the result must reflect that. 
	// This involves ordering events based on the potential causal
	// relationship of pairs of events in a concurrent system, especially
	// asynchronous distributed systems.
	// It must be guaranteed that event A finishes writing into the memory, 
	// which must be visible by event B, before B starts reading it.

	// 5.2
	// We need causal consistency to test causality violation.

	// 5.3
	// Vector Timestamps have the advantage in comparison to Lamport Timestamps
	// that Lamport timestamps does not guarantee if e1 has a smaller time stamp than e2 that it happened before
	// because concurrent events are ordered arbitrarily.
	// To detect causality violation, a VT is needed with must contain information about the other processors.


	// 5.4 
	// (A)
	// The two vectors are compared component-by-component e.g. [1,2,3] and [2,4,3] so (1 with 2 , 2 with 4 and 3 with 3).
	//
	// (B)
	// The vector components are set to the higher value, additionally the local time is increased by 1.
	//
	// (C)

	// 5.1
	// The happened-before relation is a relation between the result of two events. 
	// if one event happens before another event, the result must reflect that. 
	// This involves ordering events based on the potential causal
	// relationship of pairs of events in a concurrent system, especially
	// asynchronous distributed systems.
	// It must be guaranteed that statement A finishes writing into the memory, 
	// which must be visible by statement B, before B starts reading it.

	// 5.2
	// We need causal consistency to test causality violation.

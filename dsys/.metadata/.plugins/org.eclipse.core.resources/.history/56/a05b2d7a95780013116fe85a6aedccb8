	// Serialization is the process of converting an object's state to a
	// sequence of bytes.
	// Simple......Coverting an object to bytes and bytes back to object. So
	// when is serialization used? Serialization is used when you want to
	// persist the object. It is also used by RMI to pass objects between JVMs,
	// either as arguments in a method invocation from a client to a server or
	// as return values from a method invocation. In general, serialization is
	// used when we want the object to exist beyond the lifetime of the JVM.

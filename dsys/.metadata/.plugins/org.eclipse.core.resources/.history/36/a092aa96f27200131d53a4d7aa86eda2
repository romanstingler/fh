	// In computer science, the happened-before relation (denoted: \to \;) is a
	// relation between the result of two events, such that if one event should
	// happen before another event, the result must reflect that. Even if those
	// events are in reality executed out of order (usually to optimize program
	// flow). This involves ordering events based on the potential causal
	// relationship of pairs of events in a concurrent system, especially
	// asynchronous distributed systems. It was formulated by Leslie Lamport.
	// In Java specifically, a happens-before relationship is a guarantee that
	// memory written to by statement A is visible to statement B, that is, that
	// statement A completes its write before statement B starts its read.
